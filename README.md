This website helps non-citizens who are trying to get citizenship in the US. It has 3 main features:

1) A walkthrough of the green card and naturalization process
2) Practice questions to prepare for the Civics test
3) Estimations for how long it will take the USCIS to process cases for various forms (I-90, I-485, etc)

The live website can be found [here](https://future-citizens.herokuapp.com/)
